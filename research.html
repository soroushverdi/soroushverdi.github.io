        <strong>Mission Statement:</strong>  
        <p>
            My research investigates how people evaluate minds: how they judge beliefs, intentions, 
            emotions, and reasoning. Understanding these processes helps explain disagreement, 
            responsibility, rationality, and everyday decision-making.

    <h2>Overview of research</h2>
    <p>
        I study the psychology of belief, metacognition, reasoning, and social judgment — 
        particularly how people evaluate their own and others’ cognitive states.
    </p>

    <p>
        In one line of work, I study the <strong>lay ethics of belief</strong>: 
        how people think beliefs should form, what they consider rational, and 
        how they judge biased thinking.
    </p>

    <p>
        I also study <strong>implicit theories of reasoning</strong>, including how people 
        attribute responsibility for reasoning errors and when they think beliefs can change.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>How people judge the rationality of beliefs</li>
        <li>How they assess responsibility for biased thinking</li>
        <li>How they attribute freedom or control over mental states</li>
    </ul>
