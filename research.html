                    My research seeks to understand how consumers make decisions in increasingly digital and data-rich
                    environments. I combine experimental methods, large-scale field data, and econometric modeling to
                    study how marketing interventions shape consumer welfare and firm performance.

        <!-- Overview of research -->
        <section class="research-overview">
            <h2 class="section-title">Overview of research</h2>

            <p>
                My research lies at the intersection of consumer behavior, digital marketing, and empirical methods. I am
                particularly interested in how consumers respond to algorithmic recommendations, personalized pricing,
                and platform design choices in online marketplaces.
            </p>

            <p>
                A central theme of my work is understanding how firms can design marketing interventions that are both
                effective and ethically responsible. I investigate how transparency, fairness, and perceived control
                influence consumer trust and long-term engagement.
            </p>

            <p>
                Methodologically, I rely on a combination of:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Randomized field experiments with industry partners.</li>
                <li>Large-scale observational datasets from digital platforms.</li>
                <li>Structural and reduced-form econometric models.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                My projects cover several focus areas:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Algorithmic recommendations:</strong> how recommender systems influence consumer search,
                    consideration sets, and satisfaction.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Pricing and promotions:</strong> consumer responses to dynamic pricing, personalized offers,
                    and coupons in online retail.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Consumer privacy and trust:</strong> how data collection and disclosure policies shape
                    attitudes toward firms and platforms.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Across these areas, my goal is to generate insights that are theoretically grounded, empirically
                rigorous, and directly relevant for practitioners designing marketing strategies in digital markets.

                    This paper studies how algorithmic recommendations reshape consumer search and substitution patterns
                    in a large digital marketplace. We show that recommendation exposure can increase demand concentration
                    while also improving consumer welfare for certain product categories.
