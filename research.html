                    My research aims to develop simple, transparent models that explain complex
                    academic and technical phenomena. I prioritize clarity over complexity, focusing on
                    methods and frameworks that can be easily communicated, taught, and replicated by
                    students and colleagues across disciplines.

        <section class="overview">
            <h2>Overview of research</h2>

            <p>
                My research program is organized around the idea that simple models, when carefully
                constructed, can provide deep insights into complex systems. I work at the interface
                of theory, methodology, and application, with projects ranging from conceptual
                modeling to empirical validation.
            </p>

            <p>
                A central theme is the development of <em>interpretable frameworks</em> that remain
                faithful to real-world data while preserving mathematical and conceptual simplicity.
                This includes work on:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Designing minimal models that exhibit realistic behaviors.</li>
                <li>Developing explanatory tools for communicating model assumptions.</li>
                <li>Studying robustness and sensitivity of simplified systems.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Another focus area concerns the <em>pedagogical value</em> of simple models.
                I investigate how stripped-down examples can be used to teach complex concepts in
                undergraduate and graduate curricula, and how they can support students in building
                intuition before encountering more advanced techniques.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also collaborate with researchers in neighboring fields, applying these ideas to
                domains such as social systems, networked infrastructures, and computational
                humanities. In these collaborations, my work often centers on aligning modeling
                assumptions with substantive domain knowledge.
            </p>

            <p>
                Future projects plan to extend these foundations to:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Cross-disciplinary modeling toolkits for teaching and research.</li>
                <li>Open, reproducible repositories of simple benchmark models.</li>
                <li>Methodological guidelines for balancing simplicity and realism.</li>
            </ul>
